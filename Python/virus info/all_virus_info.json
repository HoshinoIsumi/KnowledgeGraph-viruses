Although a percentage of files are safe, sharing of files is the common breeding ground for virus spreading and distribution. Use these common usage rules to minimize the risk of receiving or spreading a virus-* Only accept files from people that you know and trust. Never accept files from people you don't know and never accept files without knowing their full purpose.* Files of executable extension such as .BAT, .EXE, .COM, .HLP, .DLL should never be accepted from others as they have the most potential to cause problems or be infected.* Scripts should not be accepted from others you do not know. Automation is another factor in the distribution of viruses and trojans.* Files which support macros should not be accepted, or if they are accepted, make sure to have macro virus protection enabled. If you are unable to verify if macro virus protection is enabled, use alternate viewers such as QuickView or Wordpad as they do not support macros. Office97 applications have viewers available from Microsoft such as Word97 Viewer. Using alternate viewers will minimize the risk of spreading macro virus infections.* Use Antivirus software to scan all files received on IRC channels. This is not a sure-fire way of detecting all viruses however known viruses can be prevented from running if vigilant scanning techniques are used.* Some IRC software applications such as mIRC support security settings or options to disable certain functions such as \"send\" or \"get\" and commands such as \"/run\" and \"/dll\". AVERT recommends setting these options if applicable. If your application supports changing options on \"DCC\" settings, choose to prompt or ignore requests for file send or receive transactions.", "removal_instructions": "Related Images"}

The IVP file can produce encrypted viruses, with a random number of NOP instructions placed in two areas of the decryption routine in an attempt to elude simple search string scanning techniques.

The boot sector of the diskette has the code to determine if the diskette is bootable, and to display the \"Non-system disk or disk error\" message. It is this code that harbors the infection. By the time the non-system disk error message comes up, the infection has occurred.Once the virus is executed, it will infect the hard drive's MBR and may become memory resident. With every subsequent boot, the virus will be loaded into memory and will attempt to infect floppy diskettes accessed by the machine.The second route of infection is by receiving an infected file through a multitude of sources including: floppy diskettes, downloads through an online service, network, modem connections, etc. Once the infected file is executed, the virus may activate.", "method_of_infection": "Removal Instructions-", "removal_instructions": ""}
